# Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Deployed Machine Learning Project)

##  Project Overview

Customer churn is a major problem in the telecom industry. Acquiring a new customer costs **5–7× more** than retaining an existing one.
This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning system that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to leave the company and provides a **churn risk probability**.

The system is deployed as an interactive web application where a user can enter customer details and instantly receive a prediction.

##  Objective

To develop a production-style ML pipeline that:

* Detects customers at risk of leaving (churn)
* Handles imbalanced data
* Provides probability-based decision support
* Is accessible through a live web interface

##  Machine Learning Approach

### Dataset

* Telco Customer Churn Dataset (IBM Sample Dataset)
* ~7,000 telecom customers
* Includes demographics, subscription plans, billing, and service usage

### Key Challenges

* Imbalanced classes (≈ 73% stay, 27% churn)
* Mixed categorical + numerical features
* Real-world deployment requirement

### Solution

* Built a preprocessing pipeline using **ColumnTransformer**
* Applied **OneHotEncoding** for categorical variables
* Handled missing values using **SimpleImputer**
* Solved class imbalance using **class_weight='balanced'**
* Used **Random Forest Classifier**
* Implemented probability-based threshold (40%) for early churn detection

## ⚙️ Model Performance

| Metric          | Score |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Accuracy        | 80%   |
| Churn Recall    | 52%   |
| Churn Precision | 68%   |
| F1 Score        | 0.58  |

The focus was not only accuracy but **detecting churn customers early**, which is more valuable for business retention strategies.
